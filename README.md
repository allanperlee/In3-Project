# In3-Project

This is an assignment from Blockchains. The intention is to use the In3 (Incubed) Python API to interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The Incubed library is intended to access data from the Ethereum blockchain as well as interact with smart contracts.

The test.py file contains the imports from Incubed. The gui.py file is the user interface containing imported modules from test.py; the file also executes other interfaces such as dp2.py (which is named after the second design pattern in PySimplyGUI) and uinodes.py (lists the nodes on each registered client). It uses the PySimpleGUI library to make a simple yet easy to make UI. 

Any questions or concerns can be e-mailed to allanperlee@hotmail.com.
